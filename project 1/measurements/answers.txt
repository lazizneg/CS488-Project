Q2.
Now, assume h1 wants to communicate with h4.  What is the expected 
latency and throughput of the path between the hosts? 

Since h1 is in s1 and h4 is in h4 i assume there should not be any issues
and the latency should be the same as I have in latency_L4 and 
throughout_L4

51.4 MBytes    --->  52.9 MBytes
15.3 Mbits/sec  -->  18.4 Mbits/sec

My predictions were on point. I believe that small differences may be due
to traffic and not in my control 

Q3.
Next, assume multiple hosts connected to s1 want to simultaneously talk 
to hosts connected to s4. What is the expected latency and throughput 
when two pairs of hosts are communicating simultaneously? Three pairs? 

As seen in the last question, I dont believe that running multiple pairs
of connection should impact the latency or throughput. I will be using
h1, h7 and h10 as they are from s1 and h4, h9 and h8 as they are from s4

H1 - H4
Transfer - 49.8 MBytes
Bandwidth - 20.9 Mbits/sec 18 Mbits/sec

H7 - H9
Transfer - 6.12 MBytes/sec
Bandwidth - 2.54 Mbits/sec 2.50 Mbits/sec

H10 - H8
Transfer - 42.7 MBytes/sec
Bandwidth - 16.6 MBits/sec 14.5 MBits/sec

Q4.
Lastly, assume h1 wants to communicate with h4 at the same time h5 wants 
to communicate with h6. What is the expected latency and throughput for 
each pair? 

h1 to h4 would go from s1 to s4
h5 to h6 would go from s5 to s6

I believe that it will take longer for h5-h6 as it has to go through both
s2 and s3 as s5 is connected to s2 and s6 is connected to s3. But s1 to s4
is a stiaght line

H1 - H4
Transfer - 51.5 MBytes
Bandwidth - 20.4 Mbits/sec 18.2 Mbits/sec

H5 - H6
Transfer - 62.9 MBytes/sec
Bandwidth - 26 Mbits/sec 23.7 Mbits/sec
